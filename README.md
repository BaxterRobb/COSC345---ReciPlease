# COSC345---ReciPlease
COSC 345 - Software engineering, app creation project.

Generate and choose from recipes based on your budget and number of people you are cooking for

**How to run the application:**

We developed ReciPlease on the iPhone 11 pro max, but our app works on any iPhone

Using Xcode, start the iPhone simulator, ideally using the iPhone 11 pro max, and enter a budget and the number of people you will be cooking for. To generate recipes, click on the 'What am I cooking' button which will lead you to three recipes to click and choose from.
